            <h2>
                My best friend was upset
            </h2>
            <p> 
                I exactly remember the date which is 05/29/2017. On that day Iwas very happy because we got our last semester result and I got good score on it. But, when i went to my college and I met my frient dinky. She is upset and supringly I do not know why she is upset because she got full grade on previous semester so according to me she should be happy for it. When I asked her that what happen why are you upset she told me that I broke up with my boy friend. Then I said oh nice congratulation.Because, I do not like her boy friend.
            </p>
            <h2>
                My friend was angry on me
            </h2>
            <p>
                She was angry on me because she did not like the way i said to her that u should be happy about that. Then I said that the person who you love him that person does not care for you. Why should you care for him and have feeling for him. I try my best to explain everything. Moreover, she does not want to talk to me and she told her boy friend about me that Janki said these things. Then her boy friend called me and told me very bad way. 
            </p>
   
            <h2>
                I was angry on her boy friend
            </h2>
            <p>
                I was very angry. In addition, I wanted him  to maintain some  distance  toward to my friend. However, my friend Dinky is set front of me on that time. I told her  that why you fucking told him everything about I said to you and  throw my phone to whall. Fruthermore, I realise that broke my phone just because of my Overreacted of small thing I could explain her in different way.She also realise that her boy friend is not the right person to her. But, it is true that we both are still togather which is good things. One more thing that I want to share which is on these situation I learned  that when we are in anger on that time make sure that our phone is far away from us(Specially for me).
